+ [OR](https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/or-function-7d17ad14-8700-4281-b308-00b131e22af0): If at least one condition is TRUE, this will return TRUE

# Logical Functions

# Nesting Functions

+ Notice we didn't rely on just one function to accomplish this task
--


![img-center-100](images/nest1.png)

# Use of Color

--

## Use color intentionally to make comprehension and interpretation easier. 
---

# Use of Color


## **For Sequential Numbers**
--

+ Use color scales with the darkest color representing the highest number and the lightest color representing the lowest number
--

+ Consider using two hues running light to dark for even more clarity

---

# Use of Color


## **For Categorical Data**
--

+ Each category gets its own color
---

# Use of Color


## **For Any Type of Data**
--

+ Consider grey to be the most important color. Use it to show the less important data while accentuating value(s) of interest in a color.

# Tips for Using Color
--

+ Be sure there's a sufficient difference between your colors
--

+ Color scales are worth exploring
--

+ Watch out for the connotation of certain colors (ex: red)
--

+ Avoid patterns
--

+ Don't use more than 6 colors
--

+ Resource for color scales: [Color Brewer](http://colorbrewer2.org)

>Clutter and confusion are failures of design, not attributes of information.

##-Edward Tufte

???
+ Class's thoughts on this? What does it mean? Do you agree?

---

# Data-Ink Ratio
--

+ Ink used to describe the data / ink used to describe everything else
--

+ Ideally, we want to minimize "ink" that's representing something other than the data (the "everything else")
<!-- + Want the ratio to be high (two numbers as close as possible to each other) -->
--

+ Tufte calls the "everything else" chartjunk

---

# Common Types of Chartjunk
--

+ Dark gridlines
--

+ Overuse of bright, bold colors
--

+ Unnecessary use of all uppercase
--

+ Unnecessary legends
--

+ Background color
