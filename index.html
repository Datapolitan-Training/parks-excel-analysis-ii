# Let's Review

---

# A Review of <br>[Introduction to Data Analytics](http://training.datapolitan.com/parks-intro-analytics/#1) and <br>[Excel for Data Analysis I](http://training.datapolitan.com/parks-excel-analysis-i/#1)

--

## In your groups, you will create a concept map of what you have learned so far
--

+ Use the ideation process
--

+ 3 minutes to brainstorm on your own
--

+ 3 minutes to share/consolidate as a group
--

+ 7 minutes to create your map


???
+ Facilitator walks group through the two 3-minute section, then moves on to next slide to explain what a concept map is

---

# Concept Mapping
--

+ A concept map demonstrates how related ideas are connected
--

+ It contains a central idea, main points, and supporting details
--

+ It has lines that demonstrate how the main points and supporting details connect with each other


???

---

# Creating Your Concept Map
--

+ Place "Data Driven Culture" at the center of your map
--

+ Identify the main points and supporting details from your post-its
--

+ Arrange the main points and supporting details around the main idea
--

+ Use arrows, lines, symbols, and colors to connect related content
--

???
+Ground participants in the 5 analytic tasks. This class will focus on the latter three.

---

# Is There a Correlation Between the # of Inspections and the # of Hours Worked?
--

![img-center-80](images/emptytable.png)

???
+Have class vote and share their hypotheses
+Do quick process map for steps to get to a completed table. Line up post-its on the wall in the front of the room.
+Main steps: Create Boro column, create table, calc values for #inspections, calc values for #hrs worked

---

# Create "Short Boro" Column

--
+ We will use the LEFT function
--

+ Useful for extracting a portion of a cell's contents\
--

Syntax

=LEFT(<span style="color:red">text</span>, <span style="color:orange">[num_chars]</span>)\
--

What it Says
=LEFT ( <span style="color:red">"use this value"</span> , <span style="color:orange">"extract the first XX characters"</span> )
--

![img-center-70](images/leftfunction.png)


---

# Create "Short Boro" Column

![img-center-70](images/leftfunctionaction.png)

---

# Create "Full Boro" Column
--

+ We will use the IF function\
--

Syntax
=IF(<span style="color:red">logical_test</span>, <span style="color:orange">[value_if_true]</span>, <span style="color:green">[value_if_false]</span>)\
--

What it Says
=IF ( <span style="color:red">"test this statement I'm telling you"</span> , <span style="color:orange">"if it's true, return this value"</span>, <span style="color:green">"if it's false, return this other value"</span> )
--

![img-center-70](images/iffunction.png)

???
+Play the formula out. What happens when it's not a B?
+What solutions can the group think of?

---

# Create "Full Boro" Column

![img-center-90](images/iffunctionaction.png)

---

# Nested Functions
--

+ Useful when one formula alone doesn't meet your needs
--

+ Often used with the IF function if there are multiple tests to be made
---

# Nested Functions
--

Syntax
=IF(<span style="color:red">logical_test</span>,<span style="color:orange">[value_if_true]</span>,<span style="color:green">IF(</span><span style="color:red">logical_test</span>,<span style="color:orange">[value_if_true]</span>,<span style="color:green">IF(</span><span style="color:red">logical_test</span>,<span style="color:orange">[value_if_true]</span>,<span style="color:green">[value_if_false]</span>)\
--

What it Says
=IF ( <span style="color:red">"test this statement I'm telling you"</span> , <span style="color:orange">"if it's true, return this value"</span>, <span style="color:green">"if it's false..."</span> <span style="color:red">"test this statement I'm telling you"</span> , <span style="color:orange">"if it's true, return this value"</span>, <span style="color:green">"if it's false..."</span> <span style="color:red">"test this statement I'm telling you"</span> , <span style="color:orange">"if it's true, return this value"</span>, <span style="color:green">"if it's false, return this other value"</span> )

---

# Create "Full Boro" Column

![img-center-80](images/nestedifs.png)\

=IF ( <span style="color:red">"test to see if B4 is equal to "B""</span> , <span style="color:orange">"if it's true, return Brooklyn"</span>, <span style="color:green">"if it's false..."</span> <span style="color:red">"test to see if B4 is equal to "Q""</span> , <span style="color:orange">"if it's true, return Queens"</span>, <span style="color:green">"if it's false..."</span> <span style="color:red">"test to see if B4 is equal to "M""</span> , <span style="color:orange">"if it's true, return Manhattan"</span>, <span style="color:green">"if it's false..."</span> <span style="color:red">"test to see if B4 is equal to "X""</span> , <span style="color:orange">"if it's true, return Bronx"</span>, <span style="color:green">"if it's false, return Staten Island"</span> )

---

# IF Function - Bonus Round
--

Nesting LEFT into IF combines the "Short Boro" and "Full Boro" columns
--

![img-center-80](images/ifbonus.png)

---

# Create the Table
--

![img-center-90](images/emptytable.png)

???
+Make new tab and create table in it

---

# Number of Inspections
--

+ We will use the COUNTIF function
--

+ Useful when you want to count the number of cells that fit a certain criteria\
--

Syntax
=COUNTIF(<span style="color:red">range</span>,<span style="color:orange">criteria</span>)\
--

What it Says
=COUNTIF (<span style="color:red">"search here"</span>, <span style="color:orange">"count every time you find this value"</span> )
--

![img-center-70](images/countiffunction.png)

---

# COUNTIF
--

![img-center-90](images/countiffunctionaction.png)

---

# Number of Hours Worked
--

+ We will use the SUMIF function
--

+ Useful when you want to add together the values in cells aligned with cells that fit a certain criteria
--

+ It can only be used on numbers\
--

Syntax
=SUMIF(<span style="color:red">range</span>,<span style="color:orange">criteria</span>,<span style="color:green">[sum_range]</span>)\
--

What it Says
=SUMIF (<span style="color:red">"look here"</span>, <span style="color:orange">"for this value"</span>, <span style="color:green">"when you find it, add the corresponding value from here"</span> )\
--

![img-center-70](images/sumiffunction.png)

---

# SUMIF
--

![img-center-80](images/sumiffunctionaction.png)

---

# Check Your Work
--

Always a good idea to double check when using formulas\
--

You can check...
--

+ With a different set of formulas
--

+ With a PivotTable
--

![img-center-70](images/pivotcheck.png)


---

class:center,middle
# What if we wanted to dig deeper into a Boro and analyze inspections and hours worked by park?

???
+Ask the class: what would we need to do to set up a similar table?
++Need to bring park name into PIP data from Daily Tasks
++Wouldn't want to type out all the park names. Time to skip to pivot tables


---
# Joining Datasets

--

Tips to prepare:
--

+ Be sure your file type(s) are Excel (.xls, .xlsx, xlm, .xlsm)
--

+ Be sure there is a common column of data
--

+ Be sure the data is the same format
--

+ Unhide and unfilter all rows
--

+ Transfer multiple workbooks into sheets in the same workbook
--

+ Create and title a new column

???
+ Before going over the tips, ask the group when joining datasets is helpful. Can they provide an example from their work?
+ How do they do "joins"?
+ What tips or best practices do they use when joining?
+ Then, go over the tips
+ Last, do the tips with the two datasets
---

# VLOOKUP

--
Syntax
=VLOOKUP ( <span style="color:red">value</span>, <span style="color:orange">table</span>, <span style="color:green">col_index</span>, <span style="color:blue">[range_lookup]</span>)\
--

What it Says
=VLOOKUP( <span style="color:red">“Find this value”</span>, <span style="color:orange">“In this table”</span>, <span style="color:green">“Once you find it, return its corresponding value in this column number”</span>, <span style="color:blue">“FALSE always”</span>)\
--

TRUE allows for a fuzzy match while FALSE requires an exact match only

---

# VLOOKUP


![img-center-90](images/vlookupfunction.png)

---

# VLOOKUP

![img-center-90](images/vlookupfunctionaction.png)

---

# PivotTable

--
+ Often bypasses the need for SUMIF and COUNTIF\
--

![img-center-80](images/pivotparks.png)

---

# Stacked Values

--
+ You can stack values in rows or columns of a PivotTable
--

+ Purpose: to show more information\
--

![img-center-80](images/stackedpivot.png)

???
+Demonstrate stacked by boro then park
+Show how you can collapse and expand the first layer (boro in this example)
---

# Your Turn

--
+ Follow the process you outlined
--

+ Document your work
--

+ You will be presenting your analysis at the end of the day
--

+ We'll be here to help

# Use of Color

--

## Use color intentionally to make comprehension and interpretation easier. \
--

## **For Sequential Numbers**
--

+ Use color scales with the darkest color representing the highest number and the lightest color representing the lowest number
--

+ Consider using two hues running light to dark for even more clarity
--

## **For Categorical Data**
--

+ Each category gets its own color
--

## **For Any Type**
--

+ Consider grey to be the most important color. Use it to show the less important data while accentuating value(s) of interest in a color.

# Tips for Using Color
--

+ Be sure there's a sufficient difference between your colors
--

+ Color scales are worth exploring
--

+ Watch out for the connotation of certain colors (ex: red)
--

+ Avoid patterns
--

+ Don't use more than 6 colors
