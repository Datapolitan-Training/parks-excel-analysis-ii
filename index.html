---

# Which Boro Has the Most Inspections
--

![img-center-90](images/inspectionsbyboro.png)

???
+ Have class vote and share their hypotheses
+ How do we get there?

---

# Create "Short Boro" Column

--
+ We will use the LEFT function
--

+ Useful for extracting a portion of a cell's contents

---

# Create "Short Boro" Column

### Syntax   
### =LEFT(<span style="color:red">text</span>, <span style="color:orange">[num_chars]</span>)
--

### What it Says   
### =LEFT ( <span style="color:red">"use this value"</span> , <span style="color:orange">"extract the first XX characters"</span> )
--

![img-center-50](images/leftfunction.png)


---

# Create "Short Boro" Column

![img-center-80](images/leftfunctionaction.png)

---

# Create "Full Boro" Column

--

+ We will use the IF function

---

# Create "Full Boro" Column

### Syntax
### =IF(<span style="color:red">logical_test</span>, <span style="color:orange">[value_if_true]</span>, <span style="color:green">[value_if_false]</span>)

--

### What it Says
### =IF ( <span style="color:red">"test this statement I'm telling you"</span> , <span style="color:orange">"if it's true, return this value"</span>, <span style="color:green">"if it's false, return this other value"</span> )
--

![img-center-40](images/iffunction.png)

???
+Play the formula out. What happens when it's not a B?
+What solutions can the group think of?

---

# Create "Full Boro" Column

![img-center-90](images/iffunctionaction.png)

---

# Nested Functions
--

+ Useful when one formula alone doesn't meet your needs
--

+ Often used with the IF function if there are multiple tests to be made
---

# Nested Functions

### Syntax
### =IF(<span style="color:red">logical_test</span>,<span style="color:orange">[value_if_true]</span>,<span style="color:green">IF(</span><span style="color:red">logical_test</span>,<span style="color:orange">[value_if_true]</span>,<span style="color:green">IF(</span><span style="color:red">logical_test</span>,<span style="color:orange">[value_if_true]</span>,<span style="color:green">[value_if_false]</span>)
--

### What it Says
### =IF ( <span style="color:red">"test this statement I'm telling you"</span> , <span style="color:orange">"if it's true, return this value"</span>, <span style="color:green">"if it's false..."</span> <span style="color:red">"test this statement I'm telling you"</span> , <span style="color:orange">"if it's true, return this value"</span>, <span style="color:green">"if it's false..."</span> <span style="color:red">"test this statement I'm telling you"</span> , <span style="color:orange">"if it's true, return this value"</span>, <span style="color:green">"if it's false, return this other value"</span> )

---

# Create "Full Boro" Column

![img-center-90](images/nestedifs.png)
--

### =IF ( <span style="color:red">"test to see if B4 is equal to "B""</span> , <span style="color:orange">"if it's true, return Brooklyn"</span>, <span style="color:green">"if it's false..."</span> <span style="color:red">"test to see if B4 is equal to "Q""</span> , <span style="color:orange">"if it's true, return Queens"</span>, <span style="color:green">"if it's false..."</span> <span style="color:red">"test to see if B4 is equal to "M""</span> , <span style="color:orange">"if it's true, return Manhattan"</span>, <span style="color:green">"if it's false..."</span> <span style="color:red">"test to see if B4 is equal to "X""</span> , <span style="color:orange">"if it's true, return Bronx"</span>, <span style="color:green">"if it's false, return Staten Island"</span> )

---

# IF Function - Bonus Round
--

### Nesting LEFT into IF combines the "Short Boro" and "Full Boro" columns
--

## Create a new column titled "Boro"

--

![img-center-100](images/ifbonus.png)

--

### ...what do you think?


???
+ Debrief nested formulas before moving on. What are their reactions? What are the pros and cons?

---

class:center,middle
# What did we just do?

???
+ Have participants explain IF in their own words
+ Pros? Cons?

---

# Conditional Formulas

--

+ IF is an example of a conditional formula
--

+ Conditional formulas make logical comparisons between expressions
--

+ They test whether the comparison is TRUE or FALSE
--

+ They take one type of action if TRUE and a different if FALSE


---

# Examples of [Conditional Formulas](https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/create-conditional-formulas-ca916c57-abd8-4b44-997c-c309b7307831)

+ [IF](https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/if-function-69aed7c9-4e8a-4755-a9bc-aa8bbff73be2)

+ [AND](https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/and-function-5f19b2e8-e1df-4408-897a-ce285a19e9d9) 

+ [OR](https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/or-function-7d17ad14-8700-4281-b308-00b131e22af0)

+ [NOT](https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/not-function-9cfc6011-a054-40c7-a140-cd4ba2d87d77)

+ [COUNTIF](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/COUNTIF-function-E0DE10C6-F885-4E71-ABB4-1F464816DF34)

+ [SUMIF](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/SUMIF-function-169B8C99-C05C-4483-A712-1697A653039B)

???
+ This is a flexible portion of class. Check in with the timing and interest level. You can choose to demo some of these other options, and how they can be nested into one another, or choose to move on.

# Inspections by Boro

--

### Let's make our chart of inspections by boro

--

![img-center-100](images/pivotinspectionboro.png)


---

# Digging Deeper

--
### What if we wanted to identify the parks with the most inspections in each boro?
--
![img-bottom-60](images/topparks.png)


???
+ Explore what it would take to look at the next level of detail. PROPID is not very friendly. What does it represent? What if we were able to identify the park name from the PROPID?

# How often do you need to combine data from different spreadsheets?

---

# [VLOOKUP](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/VLOOKUP-function-0bbc8083-26fe-4963-8ab8-93a18ad188a1)

--

### Useful for referencing data from another sheet (reference tables)

--
### Syntax
### =VLOOKUP ( <span style="color:red">value</span>, <span style="color:orange">table</span>, <span style="color:green">col_index</span>, <span style="color:blue">[range_lookup]</span>)
--

### What it Says
### =VLOOKUP( <span style="color:red">“Find this value”</span>, <span style="color:orange">“In this table”</span>, <span style="color:green">“Once you find it, return its corresponding value in this column number”</span>, <span style="color:blue">“FALSE always”</span>)
--

### TRUE allows for a fuzzy match, FALSE requires an exact match


---
# VLOOKUP

--

## Tips to prepare:
--

+ You will need a common column of data
--

+ Transfer multiple workbooks into sheets in the same workbook
--

+ Create and title a column for the new data

???
+ Before going over the tips, ask the group what tips or best practices do they use when joining?
+ Then, go over the tips
---

--
### We could create a pivot chart of all parks
<br>
--

--

![img-bottom-70](images/top3overall.png)

---

class:center,middle
# But what if we want to know the top 3 parks inspected in each boro?

---

# Stacked Values

--
+ You can stack values in rows or columns of a PivotTable
--

+ Purpose: to show more information

---

# Top Parks by Boro

--
### Place Boro above Park Name in the Rows quadrant

--

![img-center-70](images/stackedboropark.png)

---

# Top Parks by Boro

--

### Final touch: sort largest to smallest to make the chart easier to read
--

# Use of Color

--

## Use color intentionally to make comprehension and interpretation easier. 
---

# Use of Color

--

## **For Sequential Numbers**
--

+ Use color scales with the darkest color representing the highest number and the lightest color representing the lowest number
--

+ Consider using two hues running light to dark for even more clarity

---

# Use of Color

--

## **For Categorical Data**
--

+ Each category gets its own color
---

# Use of Color

--

## **For Any Type of Data**
--

+ Consider grey to be the most important color. Use it to show the less important data while accentuating value(s) of interest in a color.

# Tips for Using Color
--

+ Be sure there's a sufficient difference between your colors
--

+ Color scales are worth exploring
--

+ Watch out for the connotation of certain colors (ex: red)
--

+ Avoid patterns
--

+ Don't use more than 6 colors

>Clutter and confusion are failures of design, not attributes of information.

##-Edward Tufte

???
+Class's thoughts on this? What does it mean? Do you agree?

---

# Data-Ink Ratio
--

+ Ink used to describe the data / ink used to describe everything else
--

+ Want the ratio to be high (two numbers as close as possible to each other)
--

+ Tufte calls the "everything else" chartjunk

---

# Common Types of Chartjunk
--

+ Dark gridlines
--

+ Overuse of bright, bold colors
--

+ Unnecessary use of all uppercase
--

+ Unnecessary legends
--

+ Background color

 bring in the Sites information to the Features table
+ Insert a column next to `inspection_id`
+ This will be our key lookup value
+ Call the column "district"
+ Use this formula

```
=VLOOKUP(A2,AMPSInsExtract_Jun2016_Sites_20170613.csv!$A$1:$F$4841,2,FALSE)
```
+ Do the same for "propid" and extract the borough with a formula
+ Add "inspection_date" if that looks interesting to you
