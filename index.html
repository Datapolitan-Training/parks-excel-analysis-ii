> Facts do not "speak for themselves." They speak for or against competing theories. Facts divorced from theory or visions are mere isolated curiosities.

## -Thomas Sowell *A Conflict of Visions*

---

# What is Analysis?
--

>“Analysis is simply the pursuit of understanding, usually through detailed inspection or comparison”

## - Carter Hewgley, former Director of Analytics, [Center for Government Excellence](https://govex.jhu.edu/)
???

# A Quick Recap from <br>Data Analysis with Excel I and II

# 5 Data Analytics Tasks
???
+ Facilitator introduces the 5 main tasks of analysis
+ Facilitator reminds participants we've already done the first task
+ The goal is to dispell the "black box" sense of analytics as something mystic and unknowable
--

1. Aggregating (PivotTable)
--

2. Sorting
--

3. Filtering
--

4. Manipulating
--

5. Visualizing

---

# 1. Aggregating Data 
???
+ Facilitator reminds participants we've already done this work with the available data
+ Facilitator prompts participants to think of other ways they aggregate data for insights
--

+ Trends only become clear in aggregate
--

+ Often where you discover the "so what"
--

+ Aggregating data meaningfully can be tricky
--


![img-center-70](images/311data_parks.png)

---

# 2. Sorting
???
+ Facilitator discusses briefly the value of sorting, soliciting examples from participants of when they've sorted data for their work
--

+ Reorganize rows in a dataset based on the values in a column
--

+ Can sort on multiple columns

---

# Sorting by Date
???
+ Facilitator leads participants through simple exercise to sort data in Excel
--

![img-center-100](images/sort_overview.png)
--


![img-center-100](images/sort1_box.png)
???
+ Facilitator emphasizes the need to expand the selection, describing (or better having participants describe) the consequences of not expanding the selection

---

# Sorting by Date
![img-center-65](images/sort4a.png)
???
+ Facilitator demonstrates filtering by multiple columns
--

---

# Sorting by Date
![img-center-60](images/sort4.png)
--


![img-center-60](images/sort_final.png)
???
+ Facilitator finishes demonstration and solicits feedback from participants
---

# 3. Filtering
???
+ Facilitator leads brief discussion of filtering, soliciting examples from participants on applicability to their own work
--

+ Only show rows that contain some value
--

+ Can filter by multiple values
--

+ Can filter by values in multiple columns

---

# Filtering
![img-center-100](images/filter_slide83.png)
???
+ Facilitator demonstrates how to filter in Excel
---

# Filtering
![img-center-80](images/filtering_new_tree_slide_84.png)
???
+ Facilitator demonstrates filtering using the search box
+ This isn't a Parks example and there's [an open issue to replace the graphic](https://github.com/Datapolitan-Training/parks-excel-analysis-i/issues/14)

---

# 4. Manipulating Data (In a good way...)
???
+ Facilitator introduces topic of manipulating (or "transforming") data 
+ Solicit feedback from participants on when they need to transform the data they work with and how they do it
--

+ Sometimes available categories don't make sense
--

+ Values may not be in the format you need (or have mistakes)
--

+ You always want to have a clean copy of the data to go back to
--

+ Best to keep track of what you've done

---

# 5. Visualizing Data
???
+ Facilitator introduces the basic concepts of why we visualize data before leading participants through an exercise to create the chart shown
--

+ Quickly communicate information
--

+ Tell a clearer story
--

+ A picture is worth a thousands words
