# Let's Review

---

# A Review of <br>[Introduction to Data Analytics](http://training.datapolitan.com/parks-intro-analytics/#1) and <br>[Excel for Data Analysis I](http://training.datapolitan.com/parks-excel-analysis-i/#1)

+ In your groups, you will create a concept map of what you have learned so far
--

+ Use the ideation process
__

++ 3 minutes to brainstorm on your own
--

++ 3 minutes to share/consolidate as a group
__

++7 minutes to create your map


???
+ Facilitator walks group through the two 3-minute section, then moves on to next slide to explain what a concept map is

---

# Concept Mapping

+ A concept map demonstrates how related ideas are connected
--

+ It contains a central idea, main points, and supporting details
--

+ It has lines that demonstrate how the main points and supporting details connect with each other


???

---

# Creating Your Concept Map

+ Place "Data Driven Culture" at the center of your map
--

+ Identify the main points and supporting details from your post-its
--

+ Arrange the main points and supporting details around the main idea
__

+ Use arrows, lines, symbols, and colors to connect related content
--

???
+Walk through the steps, answer questions, then give 7 minutes to create their maps

---

++ [Daily Tasks] (xxxxxx)
--

++ [Parks Inspection Program (PIP)] (xxxxxx)

--

+ Also available on the Open Data Portal in CSV format (older data)

--

++ 3 minutes to brainstorm questions you have on your own
__

++ 3 minutes to share and consolidate your questions with your group
--

++ 3 minutes to decide on one question you will answer today


???
+Walk participants through the stages
+When it comes time to decide on the question, remind them that, to make the day more interesting, they should chose a more complex problem with multiple steps

---

# Shortened Process Mapping

+ What are the steps you will need to take to answer your question?
--

+ We will use a 3-3-3 ideation process
--

++ 3 minutes to brainstorm steps on your own
__

++ 3 minutes to share and consolidate the steps with your group
--

++ 3 minutes to arrange the steps you will take to do the analysis


???
+ Walk participants through the stages

# 5 Analytic Tasks

+ Sort
+ Filter
+ Aggregate
+ Manipulate
+ Visualize

???
+Ground participants in the 5 analytic tasks. This class will focus on the latter three.

---

# Is There a Correlation Between the # of Inspections and the # of Hours Worked?

![img-center-70](images/emptytable.png)

???
+Have class vote and share their hypotheses
+Do quick process map for steps to get to a completed table. Line up post-its on the wall in the front of the room.
+Main steps: Pull in #hrs worked, create Boro column, create table, calc values for #inspections, calc values for #hrs worked


---

# Documenting Your Work

+ Tab with running list
--

+ New tab for each step
--

+ Comments
__

+ Other ways?
--

???
+Have participants name their styles for documenting before going through the list

---

# Joining Datasets

+ Tips to prepare:
__

++ Be sure your file type(s) are Excel (.xls, .xlsx, xlm, .xlsm)
--

++ Be sure there is a common column of data
--

++ Be sure the data is the same format
--

+ Unhide and unfilter all rows
--

+ Transfer multiple workbooks into sheets in the same workbook
--

+ Create and title a new column

???
+ Before going over the tips, ask the group when joining datasets is helpful. Can they provide an example from their work?
+ How do they do "joins"?
+ What tips or best practices do they use when joining?
+ Then, go over the tips
+ Last, do the tips with the two datasets
---

# VLOOKUP

+ =VLOOKUP ( <span style="color:red">value</span>, <span style="color:orange">table</span>, <span style="color:green">col_index</span>, <span style="color:blue">[range_lookup]</span>)
--

+ =VLOOKUP( <span style="color:red">“Find this value”</span>, <span style="color:orange">“In this table”</span>, <span style="color:green">“Once you find it, return its corresponding value in this column number”</span>, <span style="color:blue">“FALSE always”</span>)
--

++ TRUE allows for a fuzzy match while FALSE requires an exact match only
